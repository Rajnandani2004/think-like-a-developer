<p class="thick"> Hello readers, I am Rajnandani. I am a student of b.tech. MnC branch at DA-IICT. I completed my highschool education from gujarat board in gujarati 
    medium. When I was in my highschools, it was COVID-19 pandemic time so I completed my studies thriugh online mode. It was quite amezing experience for me 
    to study though there were also disadvantages I faced. But it was miracle for me to get admission in DA-IICT. The board declared not to take exams 
    for this years and marks would be granted as per the marks of SSC. I was quite sure that I cannot score more than 80% in boards but this announcement
    made me achieve 95% in HSC board. In GUJCET exam, I manneged some how to score good. As the final result I got admission in DA. And I am having a 
    beautifull journey ahead. In DA, the quality of education is uncomparable. The proffesors are responsive and responsible. Seniors are also very helpfull. Besides all this 
    acedamic culture, there is anothor world for students in DA which is made up of various clubs and commitees. Here is a list of some clubs which as far as I can
    remember.
